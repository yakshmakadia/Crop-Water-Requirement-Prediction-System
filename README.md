## 📖 Project Overview

With growing water scarcity and unpredictable monsoons, especially in Gujarat, there is a critical need for precise irrigation planning.  
This project uses an **LSTM-based deep learning model** trained on historical climate, soil, and crop data to predict daily crop water requirements for **cotton, wheat, and groundnut** in Rajkot.

The project aligns with:
- **SDG 13: Climate Action**
- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**
- **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
